# helpfulthings
Things I use to help me use the internet.

These are mostly bookmarks that allow you to instantly get around ads, paywalls, or anti adblockers. I try to update them regularly.

## Usage

**Quickstart**

- Download the `helpfulthings.html` file.
- Go to your browser and find "import bookmarks"
- Select the `helpfulthings.html` file.

**Add bookmarks individually from bookmarks_src**
- Go to your browser and create a new bookmark
- Make the title something to do with the site (e.g. yewtube for the yewtube_button.txt file)
- For the address, paste the javascript code in the `.txt` file.

### Once you have the bookmarks added:
Find something you want to get around (e.g. YouTube anti-adblock)
- Click the applicable bookmark (e.g. `yewtube`)
- Enjoy your video, now through __yewtu.be__ instead of __youtube.com__
