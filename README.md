Things I use to help me use the internet.

These are mostly bookmarks that allow you to instantly get around ads, paywalls, or anti adblockers. I try to update them regularly.

## Usage

Create a new bookmark
- make the title something to do with the site (e.g. yewtube for the yewtube_button.txt file)
- for the address, paste the javascript code

Find something you want to get around (e.g. youtube anti adblock)
- Click the yewtube bookmark
- Enjoy your video, now through yewtu.be instead of youtube.com

## Contributions

If you notice a link no longer works, please create an issue with a linked PR and I will pull it in.

If you want to add a site, please create an issue to discuss.

If you want to update the repo format, please create an issue to discuss. I am open to this, I currently just use it as a folder to hold these things.
