# Site Block

This is a personal site-block for myself. When I am spending too much time on reddit or hackernews, I can turn this on and it will redirect me to the custom 403 page I created.

## Usage

1. Add a custom javascript extension to your browser
2. Add the `site_block.js` file to the extension
3. Update `site_block.js` to activate when you go to a site you wish to block.
